# PoCN projects
End-of-semester projects for the course *Physics of Complex Networks: Structure and Dynamics*, A.Y. 2024/2025 at the University of Padova.

The following two projects were chosen:
- Project 27: Robustness of noisy Quantum networks (Score: 0.6)
- Project 45: European transportation networks I (Score: 1.0)

The code for each project can be found in the respective folders. The "report" folder contains the LaTeX files for the project report. Short project descriptions and file overviews (to be added later) are given below. 

## Robustness of noisy Quantum networks
Based on this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-022-00866-7), the project aims to analyse the robustness of noisy quantum networks, focussing on Erdős–Rényi and  Barabási-Albert network models.

## European transportation networks
This projects aims to reconstruct and analyse the rail networks for different EU countries, based on the provided network data.
